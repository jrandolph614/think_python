# Development Plan 
------------------
1. Start by writing small programs with no functions.
2. Once working encapsulate it in a function and give it a name.
3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and de-bugging)
5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refractoring. For example, if you have a similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general function.
